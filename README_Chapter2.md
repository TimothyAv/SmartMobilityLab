## Using colcon to build packages
- Install colcon on Linux.
- Create a ROS 2 workspace directory.
- Clone ROS 2 example packages into the workspace.
- Build the workspace using colcon with symlink install.
- Run tests for the built packages.
- Source the environment script.
- Run example subscriber and publisher nodes.

## Creating a workspace
- Source the ROS 2 installation environment.
- Create a new workspace directory.
- Clone the ros_tutorials repository's 'foxy-devel' branch.
- Resolve dependencies and build the packages.
- Source the main ROS 2 environment and run turtlesim.

## Creating a package
- Navigate to the source directory of your ROS 2 workspace.
- Create a new ROS 2 package named "my_package" using ament_cmake build type.
- Build all packages in the workspace using colcon.
- Source your main ROS 2 installation.
- Source your workspace's setup file.
- Run the executable named "my_node" from "my_package."

## Writing a simple publisher and subscriber (C++)
- Create a new ROS 2 package named "cpp_pubsub" using the ament_cmake build type.
- Modify package.xml and CMakeLists.txt.
- Download example publisher and subscriber code.
- Build and run the package.

## Writing a simple publisher and subscriber (Python)
- Create a new ROS 2 package named "py_pubsub" using the ament_python build type.
- Modify package.xml and setup.py.
- Download example publisher code.
- Build and run the package.

## Writing a simple service and client (C++)
- Create a new package named "cpp_srvcli" with dependencies.
- Implement a service node that adds two integers.
- Implement a client node that sends a request.
- Build and run the service and client nodes.

## Writing a simple service and client (Python)
- Create a new package named "py_srvcli" with dependencies.
- Implement a service node that adds two integers.
- Implement a client node that sends a request.
- Build and run the service and client nodes.

## Creating custom msg and srv files
-Create a new package named "tutorial_interfaces."
-Define custom message and service files.
- Update package files and build the package.
- Use custom interfaces in publisher, subscriber, client, and server nodes.
